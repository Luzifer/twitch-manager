# Luzifer / twitch-manager

âš  **Project deprecated:** This project is no longer maintained as the [Twitch-Bot](https://github.com/Luzifer/twitch-bot) now is capable of serving overlays and handling events. So in order to reduce the amount of projects having the same purpose and mostly the same functionality this project is discontinued and will receive neither security nor functional updates.

----

Twitch-Manager is intended as an alternative to having overlays managed by Streamlabs or Streamelements and therefore having more control over the overlay, the availability and how they work.

At the moment it is a work-in-progress and does not yet implment all events it shall manage in the future.
