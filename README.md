# Luzifer / twitch-manager

Twitch-Manager is intended as an alternative to having overlays managed by Streamlabs or Streamelements and therefore having more control over the overlay, the availability and how they work.

At the moment it is a work-in-progress and does not yet implment all events it shall manage in the future.
